      <p>NYCHA's housing complexes may be in for another bitter winter.</p>
      A May 28 audit by New york City Comptroller Scott Stringer found that an inadequate system for both tracking work orders as they're filed as well as their resolution.
      NYCHA has championed the goal of total completion of work order complaints within a 24 hour period for its residents.
      In 2018, the reality was 91% of completed work orders in a 48 hour period.
      <p> Is NYCHA ready for a massive influx of heating calls?

      <div>
        <p> NYCHA is required to provide heat to its residents between October 1st to May 31st, when they anticipate temperatures fall below 53 degrees. It isn't clear if NYCHA requires a set amount of days where the temperature falls below 52
          degrees before providing heat in its buildings. </p>

        <p> New York City Scott Stringer highlighted steps for NYCHA to remedy the gap in heating and boiler inspections, of which NYCHA only agreed to three. Comptroller Stringer described the situation as a systemic pitfall to manage and remedy
          heating complaints.
          The audit also found a lack of transparency. NYCHA does not currently have a way to track the resolution of individual work orders affecting apartments. Instead the system is geared toward tracking overarching issues plaging entire
          complexes </p>

        <p> NYCHA maintains 21 housing units in the South Bronx. Eight are in Mott Haven while 13 are in Hunts Point. Over 400,000 people live in NYCHA housing throughout New York City </p>
